# [CPIC API Overview](https://github.com/cpicpgx/cpic-data/wiki)
This is a great resource for the CPIC API. 

# [CPIC API Examples](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1446428/Szt78VUJ?version=latest)
This is a great resource to identify the various features we could build. It provides example of different API calls using postman. A couple features that'd be ideal include:
- Find all CPIC guidelines
- Find a CPIC guideline by drug
- Find a recommendation given a drug & gene pair
- Find all drugs that have an associated CPIC guideline
- Find all gene-drug pairs and their associated guidelines
