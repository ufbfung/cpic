## BIOMED210/CS270 Pharmacogenetics (PGX) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Tool

### Background
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) represents one of the fundamental steps towards personalized medicine. With the availability of genetic tests for more than 15 years and a significant number of patients having at least one actionable genetic variant, it may seem peculiar that it isn’t more widely adopted in routine clinical practice. Pharmacogenetic tests results can identify opportunities where drugs may need to be modified, if not discontinued, due to a patient’s drug metabolism where it may be either too high or low.

We implemented a minimal viable product (MVP) that leverages the CPIC's API to retrieve the most recent drug-gene guidelines based on input of a drug and genetic phenotype. If the latter is unknown, clinicians can enter the ethnicty of the patient and the most likely genetic phenotype will be displayed in order of probability.
